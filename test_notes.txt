# Notes

- The limit on the size of a placement isn't useful.
  You can break it, and sometimes you sort of have to,
  to place single-pixels.
x The deleter is wrong.
- Tooltip text is at the wrong position! (defer)
- Make tooltip band around properly. (defer)

- Reinvision the plaeer to ensure maximum
  satisfaction in the level.

- Pressing shift when there's nothing in the grid
  and you're holding a chisel causes the mouse to to
  the top left.

- When you move left/right and toggle fullscreen,
  the position isn't kept properly.

Level 3 - The fireplace isn't very good.
        - It isn't cool enough.
        - The actual chiseling doesn't feel satisfying.

Level 5 - It's not clear what the thing you're taking
          steam out from is.

Level 6 - Super forgettable.
        - The initial level doesn't say anything.
          It's just some random shit.

Level 7 - Make the initial like a completed painting.

Level 8 - The initial state is not good. Make it interesting.

Level 9 - Same as level 8.

Level 10 - Initial state is not good.

- Destroying the initial state of levels is not fun. It makes me
  not want to play this game.
- Have a better progression of difficulty. It gets too hard too fast.
- -1 amount in the conversion! no!
- Stop conversion if the output is stopped due to inefficient materials.
- The overlay gets too dark when not on the correct material type.
  See: level 8.
- The conversions are not fun!!!! It makes me not want to play it.
  Focus on the sculpting.



# Main Issues

- The converter isn't very good; we must re-evaluate it and possibly
  remove many elements.
    - The design has stayed the same for a long time, and the conversions
      themselves were picked arbitrarily. We should employ a design-by-
      subtraction philosophy here.
    - So, remove many elements from the conversions and make it more
      streamlined. The conversions GUI menu is obnoxious.

- The placer is odd and finnicky, and should be much different. You can
  essentially cheat the system by just doing tiny placements, removing
  the entire purpose of the chisel... but also tiny placements are sort
  of required for certain things...
    Possibilities:
    - Have a certain rectangle that you can change the dimensions of,
      and that can't go smaller than a certain size.

- The levels are too finnicky to create, and feel like you're breaking
  the game by doing certain things. This is not at all ready.
    - This must be improved. Rework all levels to feel like level 2,
      which is the best level.

- The levels have initial states that don't really say much, and are just
  randomly placed. They should give insight into the narrative.

- The initial states of levels are too tedious to destroy. They kill all my
  enthusiasm. I even included a debug shortcut to delete the entire level
  because of how terrible this is. That's a red flag right there.
