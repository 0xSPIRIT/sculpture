# Notes

(Completed)
Level 3 - The fireplace isn't very good. It isn't cool enough.
        - The actual chiseling doesn't feel satisfying here,
          but that's only due to the shape being insufficient.

(Completed)
Level 5 - It's not clear what the thing you're taking steam out from is.
          It makes it really weird. Just remove this, honestly.
        - The sculpture is too difficult compared to 4!

Level 6 - Super forgettable.
        - The initial level doesn't say anything. It's just some random shit.

Level 7 - Make the initial like a completed painting.

Level 8  - The initial state is not good. Make it interesting.
Level 9  - Same as level 8.
Level 10 - Same as level 9.

- Destroying the initial state of levels is not fun. It makes me
  not want to play this game.
- Have a better progression of difficulty. It gets too hard too fast.
- The conversions are not fun!!!! It makes me not want to play it.
  Focus on the sculpting.

# Main Issues

- The converter isn't very good; we must re-evaluate it and possibly
  remove many elements.
    - The design has stayed the same for a long time, and the conversions
      themselves were picked arbitrarily. We should employ a design-by-
      subtraction philosophy here.
    - So, remove many elements from the conversions and make it more
      streamlined. The conversions GUI menu is obnoxious.
    - Do this one before reworking the levels.
=========
  (Update: I think the major parts like fuel types, marble, sandstone,
   etc. are decent but just need to be refined, especially the later
   levels which seem more tedious to create the later materials than
   anything else.)
=========

- The placer is odd and finnicky, and should be much different. You can
  essentially cheat the system by just doing tiny placements, removing
  the entire purpose of the chisel... but also tiny placements are sort
  of required for certain things...
    Possible Solution:
    - Have a certain rectangle that you can change the dimensions of,
      and that can't go smaller than a certain size.

- The levels are too finnicky to create, and feel like you're breaking
  the game by doing certain things. This is not at all ready.
    - This must be improved. Rework all levels to feel like level 2,
      which is the best level.
    - Levels are too hard, especially near the end.

- The levels have initial states that don't really say much, and are just
  randomly placed. They should give insight into the narrative.

- The initial states of levels are too tedious to destroy. They kill all my
  enthusiasm. I even included a debug shortcut to delete the entire level
  because of how terrible this is. That's a red flag right there.
    - Solution: Add a "destroy" button at the start that can be used at
                any time. It acts as though you chiseled everything, with
                all the material being added to your inventory.
