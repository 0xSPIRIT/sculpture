# Bugs

- The text for the confirmation goes up to the top left in the restart-level popup.

- Pressing shift when there's nothing in the grid
  and you're holding a chisel causes the mouse to to
  the top left.

- -1 amount in the conversion! no!
   Stop conversion if the output is stopped due to inefficient materials.

- The overlay gets too dark when not on the correct material type. See: level 8
  Improve overlay contrast in general. See: level 4 (heart of glass)

- Crash on level 7 when trying to press N to go to the next
  level. The buttons in the confirmations seem to be pointing to
  nowhere useful.
