# Bugs

- The overlay gets too dark when not on the correct material type. See: level 8
  Improve overlay contrast in general. See: level 4 (heart of glass)

- Crash on level 7 when trying to press N to go to the next
  level. The buttons in the confirmations seem to be pointing to
  nowhere useful.

- An issue with the I-key menu. Sometimes it doesn't draw? When I was
  in fullscreen, it wasn't drawing until I came out of fullscreen.
