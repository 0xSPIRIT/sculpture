# Bugs

- The text for the confirmation goes up to the top left in the restart-level popup.

- Pressing shift when there's nothing in the grid
  and you're holding a chisel causes the mouse to to
  the top left.

- -1 amount in the conversion! no!
   Stop conversion if the output is stopped due to inefficient materials.

- The overlay gets too dark when not on the correct material type. See: level 8
  Improve overlay contrast in general. See: level 4 (heart of glass)

- Crash on level 7 when trying to press N to go to the next
  level. The buttons in the confirmations seem to be pointing to
  nowhere useful.

- If you place something, then switch to a chisel, it chiels.

- An issue with the I-key menu. Sometimes it doesn't draw? When I was
  in fullscreen, it wasn't drawing until I came out of fullscreen.

- If you place dirt, sometimes it doesn't fall?

- The chisel follows you in the gui popup, if there is nothing in the
  grid.
