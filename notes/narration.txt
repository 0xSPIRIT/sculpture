You inch towards three blocks of stone,
accompanied by an array of chisels.
Your gaze intensifies, longing for something.
a glimmer previously dormant ignites in you.

As you acquaint yourself with the basics,
your imagination fills with exotic new ideas.
It scratches an itch you never knew you had,
daydreaming even outside of the workshop.
Your single flame glares with bliss.

Which shapes and patterns beg to be sculpted?
Wondrous minutes went by,
daydreaming fantastical possibilities.
You can fully picture it:
A symbolic piece with endless complex details.
... No.
Only when you've sharpened your skills,
will you dare to create something real.
The flame flickers for a moment.

Surely by now you were ready, right?
To do something detailed- important.
You recall the sculptures that you once loved.
Hypnotized by an idea, you return to the here and now.
Your expectations surely tempered, you pick up your chisel.

At the end you should be proud, but how could you?
It's a sudden jolt back to reality-
To the detached, and dispassionate.
With compromise after compromise,
this is all you could settle for?
A bastardized fraction of what it should have been?
You turn away scathingly in contempt,
the chisel clattering on the floor.
"I'll never make this mistake again," you say,
"I'll never settle for anything less than what is expected."

A thought captures you once again,
liquifying boldly into many ideas,
but this time, you're ready.
Glaring white radiates from your imagination,
outlining an object with layers of diamond and ice.
The prize taunts you. It aches for you to reveal it.
You can do this.
You know you can.
You have to.

With your perfected craftsmanship, you continue on.
You'd sculpt an intricate, sophisticated piece-
In fact, very similar to several of your favorites.
Your expertise should clean this one up nicely.
You've earned a break.

Fixed in place, you stare out your window.
You watch as the people go by.
Life goes on, but you are simply not there.
With the true depth of your work in sight,
you realize you can't do what they did;
yearning to masquerade around as some auteur.
Maybe that's not such a bad thing.
...
Let's move to Alaska.
We'd sculpt the little birds and trees.
And it'd feel good.
