# Story

The game is a metaphor for the creation of art in general,
with the conversion of pre-existing material into new
materials being allegorical to inspiration -> ideas ->
implementation.

It follows Max, a beginner sculptor, on his way through
the mastery of his craft. He first begins with the simple
joy of creating and learning in the first few levels,
but then slowly falls victim to his ambition. He has
desires of making these magnificent masterpieces, often
being inspired by the most popular sculptures of all time.

He pushes himself to his limit, although he creates
decent looking sculptures. At the end, he gains such
pride and confidence in his work that he thinks of himself
as a master, or close to it. He has expertise now.

Finally, his ambition takes hold of him once more, with
the final level being impossible to complete. The
"inspiration" for that level, being a superhero figure
is representative of his state of mind.
