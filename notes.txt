Problems:

- There isn't a good way to destroy massive portions, for eg.
    with the level where you start off with a finished scene and
    work backwards, no one wants to large-chisel their way through
    everything. Make a bomb!!

- Fuel needs to work much slower.

- Add storage spaces in the converter GUI.

- The pickup layer feels very clunky, and materials should just
  automatically be added to an inventory, that is accessed via
  the converter's GUI.

The converter system is very very good. It just needs some adjusting
to make it viable, and produce more material than it does currently.

- Add more levels!
    - Add Level 7 - Birdie
       - Garbage -> Nice Birdie.
       - Relatively converter-heavy.
       - Sandstone + Marble -> Quartz
       - Quartz + Marble & lava -> Granite.

       - Contains:
          - Cobblestone, sand
               to make sandstone, marble, unref. coal, and glass to make ref. coal.
          - Cobblestone + Ref. Coal -> Lava
          - Use the ref. coal to make Quartz
          - Use the lava to make granite.
    - Add Level 8 - Polished Turd: Dirt to Diamond: Statue of David (crap version)
    - Add Level 9 - Showpiece: Hand holding orb
       - Quartz
       - Granite
       - Diamond
       - Dirt in center.
    - Add Level 10 - Brittle Body: Body shape.

== Complete by the end of Saturday ==
Use a timer to make sure you do it properly

- Replace placer with eyedropper sprite.

- Think about adding an object joiner? Don't add it unless you know it's a
  good idea.
- Chisel pattern still needs work.

- For the beginning levels, you use the predefined overlay, but for the later
  levels, you make your own overlays/helpers and just use the refernce
  image window on the side.

- Add Zoom + WASD Movement to make things easier & more precise when
    working with the chisel.

- The blob generator still needs some work to make it feel less
    scary and freaky when you're chiseling. It should have a very consistent
    feeling to it.

Notes:

To reduce tediousness, remove focus from chiseling. You start doing it
manually in the first level, then you learn about the chisel blocker, etc.
Tutorialization is very important here. Show things that might seem obvious
as the dev. At some point you get an automatic chiseler; you highlight a region
and it chisels it for you. So then, you'd just be sort of at an architectural
or planning level, and not being bogged down by the tediousness.

Of cousre, if the levels are given to you specifically as in the first levels,
it'd just be very boring. The point of the future levels is to be given
a prompt, and create something from that prompt, and judge it from your own
merit.

How do I portray having too much ambition & your skill level not being as
high as you originally thought?
