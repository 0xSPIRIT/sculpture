Problems:

- A main issue that we have is that the level simply doesn't 
  have the necessary amount of starting materials to make the conversions
  have the proper amount in them. The screens are simply just too
  small. So we must increase the value of each cell, perhaps?
- A definite no-no would be creating more than you have, which would mean
  that you're creatin gthings out of nowhere. Horrible, especially
  considering the themes of the game. No, the cell values you get from
  each destroy must increase.
- I think it wouldn't really make much sense to increase the value of each cell, 
  because wouldn't that be sort of defeating the point? It's like inflation.
- So, I think that the best way to solve this problem would be to have
  different caches that you could destroy with the chisel that gives you
  some large amount of material. The screen is just too small too yield
  the amount of raw materials required, especially since it maybe several
  layers down that you get the actual final materials, which may be a
  very low yield from the start, like 25% or something..

- There isn't a good way to destroy massive portions, for eg.
  with the level where you start off with a finished scene and
  work backwards, no one wants to large-chisel their way through
  everything. Make a bomb!!

The converter system is very very good. It just needs some adjusting
to make it viable, and produce more material than it does currently.

- Should the levels have a proper evaluater for each level, or just make it
  player-based? I think player-based would be more interesting, since we're
  able to take risks and since it's such a short game. I think finishing
  the levels based on your own merit is an important part in conveying
  the themes, because otherwise, it's not you who's judging it, it's
  "something else". One of the main points is that this is all internal
  conflict, not some external validation problem.

- Replace placer with eyedropper sprite.

- Think about adding an object joiner? Don't add it unless you know it's a
  good idea.
- Chisel pattern still needs work.

- For the beginning levels, you use the predefined overlay, but for the later
  levels, you make your own overlays/helpers and just use the refernce
  image window on the side.

- Add Zoom + WASD Movement to make things easier & more precise when
    working with the chisel.

- The blob generator still needs some work to make it feel less
    scary and freaky when you're chiseling. It should have a very consistent
    feeling to it.

////////////////////////////////

To reduce tediousness, remove focus from chiseling. You start doing it
manually in the first level, then you learn about the chisel blocker, etc.
Tutorialization is very important here. Show things that might seem obvious
as the dev. At some point you get an automatic chiseler; you highlight a region
and it chisels it for you. So then, you'd just be sort of at an architectural
or planning level, and not being bogged down by the tediousness.

Of cousre, if the levels are given to you specifically as in the first levels,
it'd just be very boring. The point of the future levels is to be given
a prompt, and create something from that prompt, and judge it from your own
merit.

How do I portray having too much ambition & your skill level not being as
high as you originally thought?

Answer: As far as I can tell, the final level does this pretty well.
        Once the player feels like they are able to do this since
        the other levels are not Dark Souls level difficult, the
        theme should be set in there.
