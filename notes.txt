Problems:

For the lined up blobs:
	The issue that arises is that there isn't any depth to the chiseling.
	It's a bit buggy but even if it wasn't, it still feels too odd.

- There isn't a good way to destroy massive portions, for eg.
  with the level where you start off with a finished scene and
  work backwards, no one wants to large-chisel their way through
  everything. Make a bomb!!

The converter system is very very good. It just needs some adjusting
to make it viable, and produce more material than it does currently.

- Add more levels!
    - Add Level 7 - Birdie
       - Garbage -> Nice Birdie.
       - Relatively converter-heavy.
       - Sandstone + Marble -> Quartz
       - Quartz + Marble & lava -> Granite.

       - Contains:
          - Cobblestone, sand
               to make sandstone, marble, unref. coal, and glass to make ref. coal.
          - Cobblestone + Ref. Coal -> Lava
          - Use the ref. coal to make Quartz
          - Use the lava to make granite.
    - Add Level 8 - Polished Turd: Dirt to Diamond: Statue of David (crap version)
    - Add Level 9 - Showpiece: Hand holding orb
       - Quartz
       - Granite
       - Diamond
       - Dirt in center.
    - Add Level 10 - Brittle Body: Body shape.

- Should the levels have a proper evaluater for each level, or just make it
  player-based? I think player-based would be more interesting, since we're
  able to take risks and since it's such a short game. I think finishing
  the levels based on your own merit is an important part in conveying
  the themes, because otherwise, it's not you who's judging it, it's
  "something else". One of the main points is that this is all internal
  conflict, not some external validation problem.

- Replace placer with eyedropper sprite.

- Think about adding an object joiner? Don't add it unless you know it's a
  good idea.
- Chisel pattern still needs work.

- For the beginning levels, you use the predefined overlay, but for the later
  levels, you make your own overlays/helpers and just use the refernce
  image window on the side.

- Add Zoom + WASD Movement to make things easier & more precise when
    working with the chisel.

- The blob generator still needs some work to make it feel less
    scary and freaky when you're chiseling. It should have a very consistent
    feeling to it.

////////////////////////////////

To reduce tediousness, remove focus from chiseling. You start doing it
manually in the first level, then you learn about the chisel blocker, etc.
Tutorialization is very important here. Show things that might seem obvious
as the dev. At some point you get an automatic chiseler; you highlight a region
and it chisels it for you. So then, you'd just be sort of at an architectural
or planning level, and not being bogged down by the tediousness.

Of cousre, if the levels are given to you specifically as in the first levels,
it'd just be very boring. The point of the future levels is to be given
a prompt, and create something from that prompt, and judge it from your own
merit.

How do I portray having too much ambition & your skill level not being as
high as you originally thought?

Answer: As far as I can tell, the final level does this pretty well.
        Once the player feels like they are able to do this since
        the other levels are not Dark Souls level difficult, the
        theme should be set in there.
