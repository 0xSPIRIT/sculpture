Major Milestones:

x Tutorialization
- Fix levels & gameplay according to playtesting
- Sound effects & Music
- Narrator
- Title Screen
- Ending (Fall & Credits)

Problems:

How do I improve the chisel? Make it easier to show how it works, because I
actually do like how it is right now.

- Should the levels have a proper evaluater for each level, or just make it
  player-based? I think player-based would be more interesting, since we're
  able to take risks and since it's such a short game. I think finishing
  the levels based on your own merit is an important part in conveying
  the themes, because otherwise, it's not you who's judging it, it's
  "something else". One of the main points is that this is all internal
  conflict, not some external validation problem.

- Chisel pattern still needs work.

- Predefined overlays are working fine... is it really necessary to
  need to make your own? Esp. with such a short game... I would
  really like for the overlay to be user made but also the way it's
  in the game right now is also great.

- Add Zoom + WASD Movement to make things easier & more precise when
  working with the chisel.

How do I portray having too much ambition & your skill level not being as
high as you originally thought?

Answer: As far as I can tell, the final level does this pretty well.
        Once the player feels like they are able to do this since
        the other levels are not Dark Souls level difficult, the
        theme should be set in there.

The orb represents a goal, unreachable. It means "SUCCESS", but coming
only from a wrong definition. It also represents Mavien, the game.

The levels represents the progression of an artist's work; from simple beginnings
to more and more complex creations, with lots of layers of conversions required
to convert from inspiration to an actual finished piece. The showpiece is the
climax of all the complexity that you are able to actually create. The final
level is literally impossible to create, but you've deluded yourself into
thinking you can complete it if you nudge it just a *little* bit more. It's
meant to portray that sense of defeat, like all you've done is invalidated
because your ambition is too high.

The ending described in one word: ambition.
