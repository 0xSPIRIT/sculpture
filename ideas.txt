- Have some kind of recipe map showing converter_convert()?
- Reduce wasted space in popup- only furnace needed.
- Put toolbar on left instead of top? Leave space for metadata?

For Level 2 (Conversion), we still need to get a shape.
   Possibilities:
     - Gravestone (too complex for level 2?)

I think chiseling shapes is sort of too complex, but we'll need
playtesting to make sure that is the case. If it is too complex, then
we can change the chisel blocker to have more nodes, or have a line
mode where it's a bunch of points you can move around with only
straight lines. You can then switch between this mode (default) and
the smooth mode (we'll do a pixelizer pass on this like Aseprite).
