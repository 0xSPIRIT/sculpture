Playtest Notes 15.12.22:

- Make chisel work while tutorials are up.
- Rais generally prefers using chisels horizontally. Doesn't realize
  that using it vertically or diagonally can make things alot
  faster by spam clicking.
- Used the deleter for everything after it was mentioned. Make sure
  it's known that you only need to use it periodically.
- Click and drag to place rectangles.
- Show that you can do a general rectangle first, then chisel it out.
  But sometimes, drawing small rectangles is the way to go. Your choice.
- There is no measure as to how much cells is alot or a little.
- Make placing the same material two times in the inputs be equivalent to 
  inputting one. (Saleem)
- Very opposed to using the chisels, which is the main way of creating the 
  sculptures.
- Show when you chisel something, it goes into your inventory.
- Make the chisels more consistent, and easier to deal with.
- Make F1-F5 visible underneath each inventory slot.
- Placing objects next to each other that are different material types 
  doesn't actually join them together.
- Make the convert icon be more buttoney.
