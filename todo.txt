TODO :: {

	[ ] Change level 6 to fit the theme of having too much ambition,
		and your views of projects shifting over time, since it's
		above your skill level. Change the overlay over time, slowly
		scaling it down; at some point start removing major elements
		such as limbs or whatever. At the end, you end up with a much
		simpler idea than what you started with.
	[ ] Narrative - Only do in front of the major levels, not all.
				  - It gives everything some space in general.
	[ ] Change some more levels to fit the narrative - make everything
		have a purpose.
	[ ] Redo the software renderer

}

Future TODO (Vague) :: {
	[ ] Dust is still emitted if on blocker.

	[ ] Tutorial: Make use of the chisel's ability to move after you've clicked,
		perhaps utilize simple video tutorials.

	[ ] Bug with small chisel not getting cells properly. Noticable in level 4.

	[ ] The chisels are limited to blobs by object. If a big circle goes
		over one object of 5 cells, but mostly destroys another object,
		it only does the small 5 cells. Destroy ALL objects.
