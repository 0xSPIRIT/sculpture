# TODO

{
  - For chisels, when in the vicinity of multiple possible points, auto-adjust
    to the one that chisels correctly, rather than the multiple others which
    do not.

  - Redo level 10. This is way too hard and not good with the way placers work
    Keep the same general idea of layers of diamond and ice, but make it
    not weird and clunky.

  - Determine if the destroy level tool is even necessary?
    Replace it with a restart level thing instead?

  x For undoing, instead of undoing via checking if the current grid is the
    same as the last saved state, check via keeping track of if the player
    either placed anything, chiseled anything, or destroyed the level.
    Doing it this way eliminates the weirdness of trying to undo a placement
    of material in the air (which immediately falls, thereby changing the
    state)

}
  - For level 7, change the confirmation popup when you finish to "no" and "no"
    instead of confirm and cancel.

  - Evaluate if the placer is good.
    - In level "Yearning" the placer is a bit odd? Maybe not though.

  - Improve conversions (design by subtraction) - see test_notes.txt.

  - Test the new implemented placer. // Must be done after levels are redone!

  - Graphics :: make it have a rustic feel.

  - Music
     - Ambient: piano, pads/synths, motifs?

  - Hand-make sprites for each rotation.

  - Level 7's narration feels weird!

  - Add a mouse feature for the web version to emulate the movement
    of the mouse in the desktop version.

  - Make a graph of all dates of the files in C:\Users\ameer\AppVerifierLogs
