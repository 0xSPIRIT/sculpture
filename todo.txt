# TODO

  x The thing with the steam isn't consistent as it only appears
    once in the game. Also, sometimes the rain is just there for
    show, eg. level 6.
     x Maybe rework the narration for level 5.

  - Test out some shadows (WIP) [shadows.c]

  - Music
     - Ambient: piano, pads/synths, motifs?

  - Graphics :: make it have a rustic feel.

  - Hand-make sprites for each rotation.

  - Make a graph of all dates of the files in C:\Users\ameer\AppVerifierLogs
