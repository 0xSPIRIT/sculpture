TODO

  - Move the Note: in the material converter section of the recipe book
    to be item counts instead.

  - The whole thing with Max not making the sculptures to his desires
    doesn't work as well if the player doesn't adhere to Max's desired-s
    in the first couple levels. So we need to explicitly make it so that
    Max is fine doing whatever he wants with the first couple levels,
    because he doesn't view it as "real". Level 7+ however he believes
    are more significant to him.

  - Something to do with the rain preferring the left side of
    the scene, when stuff is splashing on to material?

  - Music!!!!!! Focus on the music! Don't procrastinate it!
     - Ambient: piano, pads/synths, motifs?

  - Make the rain be used in another level? Feels underused

  - Graphics :: make it have a rustic feel.
    - GUI
    - Chisels (Improve)

  - Make a graph of all dates of the files in C:\Users\ameer\AppVerifierLogs
