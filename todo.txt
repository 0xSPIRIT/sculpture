TODO :: Sunday {

    [ ] Add inventory slots
         [x] Make it work with placing items into it.
         [ ] Make the sucking in placer obsolete by automatically adding
             to inventory.

    [ ] Make fuel slower (make it easier to make fuel) (amount should be f32?)
    [ ] Replace the placer with an eyedropper sprite.

    [ ] How are overlays going to work? Predefined for all levels? I don't think so.
        Write response after you've though about it:
