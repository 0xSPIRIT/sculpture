Future TODO (Vague) :: {       [Don't actually use this list.]
	[ ] Fix blobs going across the screen.

    - Better way to destroy large objects.

	- Tutorialization:  when a chisel doesn't have the pressure to delete
						a cell, use the deleter.

	Only do this later:
    - View (WASD + Scroll to compensate for chisel going offscreen)
}
