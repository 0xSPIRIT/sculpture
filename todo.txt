Today:

- Create way to view the desired grid for a level.
- Set level 1's desired_grid to the house (from image)
- Create an end level screen (activated by button, do GUI later)
    - Show difference between yours and desired_grid.
    - Go to next level
- Add a way for the placer to pick up certain particles. Only non-hard
  objects are allowed. (placer suck mode)


- Add dust to chiseling.

Polish
- Fix the crashes [do some wacky shit lots of placements while running
  in gdb] usually has to do with changing the tool as well. Also
  it sometimes removes some cells in the middle of the screen?? OOB
  array?
- Figure out a simple way to explain all this to the player. Esp
  overheating and placers with the converter.
- Make the blobs for each different type of stone different to give
  them a different feel.
- Make a better GUI for switching tools, and especially different
  placers. The F1-3 system we have going on is whack.
