TODO

  - Delete surfaces.
  x Make cursor invisible in ending.
  - Remember that this is all just so we can 1. have cleaner shit and
    2. be able to have negative coordinates on render targets, without
    the original calls having to do anything.
 
  - Redo all rendering code to allow for larger textures.
     - Implement an abstraction layer for rendering, which we desperately need.
     - We'd simplify rendering targets.
     - And make things more explicit when we're working with pixel-level or
       screenspace-level.
     - Implement the feature of adding negative positions into rendering targets,
       so most of our actual rendering code can stay the same, and just allow
       for negative coordinates.
     - Also, redo the entire asset file. Horrible stuff.
  - Make a proper UI system. Redo all that code as well.

  - Redo all levels.
    - Add another level 7 thing but in reverse? Perhaps do it before 7.
    - Ensure the progression is step-by-step.

  - Cool gradient background.

  - Graphics :: make it have a rustic feel.

  - Music.

  - Hand-make sprites for each rotation.

  - Add a mouse feature for the web version to emulate the movement
    of the mouse in the desktop version.

  - Make a graph of all dates of the files in C:\Users\ameer\AppVerifierLogs
