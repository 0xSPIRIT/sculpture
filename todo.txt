TODO
  x Change the narration to have multiple lines per thing. Upon
    each enter press, it adds a new line. Perhaps newlines within
    a thing is marked by \r's whereas proper new lines are marked
    by \n's.

  - Add the 3rd person narration in, and see how it works.

  - Show when the chisel isn't able to chisel better. It makes it
    seem like a bug.
  - Add a mouse feature for the web version to emulate the movement
    of the mouse in the desktop version.
  - Debug crash that happens when you Ctrl+G through many levels
    until you end up at level 7. Something with the memory gets messed
    up which first manifests as the snow being less in the opening. Very curious.
