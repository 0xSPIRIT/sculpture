This is what we WILL do today.

Refactor:
x Bounds checking with grid[] access.
x Replace ints with booleans where useful.

Features / Bug Fixes:
x Chisel FG stuff.
x Make popup box shift if it's off the screen to the right or bottom.
x Reformat some of the weird jumbled converter.c code.
x Create Level Remainder
    x Source cells for steam.
    x Create the actual level.

Later
- Make the blobs for each different type of stone different to give
  them a different feel.
- Better GUI for switching placers.
- Make face chiseling look better... somehow. Figure out a solution
