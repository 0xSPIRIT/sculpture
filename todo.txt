  - Music
    - Redo the ending music. Make it more like a solemn acceptance.
    - Make music that corresponds to each area (background change)
      - Piano, electronic, ambient, slowly getting more distorted for each area.
        Tons of empty space in the music. 7 minute long tracks?
        Not just sprinkles like before, use actual melodies, but don't make it
        annoying. Melodic tracks can exist without being annoying!

  - Make a graph of all dates of the files in C:\Users\ameer\AppVerifierLogs
