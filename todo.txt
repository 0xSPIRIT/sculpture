      --------------------------TODO----------------------------

x FIX THE LAYERED GRID BUG.
x New Tool: Hammer. You hit a hard material and it breaks into its
  blobs and falls to the ground (new layer). Then, you can pick them
  up with placers.
- Make Level 5 - "Carbon Copy"
- Make rectangle placement work with setting objects placer.

- Remove really odd blobs generated using blob_generate_smart, also
  single-celled blobs (isn't this impossible? Maybe it is.) Perhaps
  redo the entire algorithm??
- Make the blobs for each different type of stone different to give
  them a different feel.
- Better GUI for switching placers.
- Make face chiseling look better... somehow. Figure out a solution

     ---------------------------Ideas----------------------------

- Orb imagery! Use it in Diamond & Quartz!
  Figures reaching for something that is offscreen
  then we finally see it's the orb

- Perhaps a new converter that requires a fuel source (water / coal?)
  and can create more complex materials, eg. diamond, marble, quartz.
  This creates a natural limitation for what materials you can create.

- Have some kind of recipe map showing converter_convert()?
- Reduce wasted space in popup- only furnace needed.
- Put toolbar on left instead of top? Leave space for metadata?

For Level 2 (Conversion), we still need to get a shape.
It must be simple enough to be the second level (you're still getting
used to the chiseling etc.) but also complex enough to be thematically
relevent. I don't want any level to not be thematically tied because
there's just so little of them and the game must be as polished as
possible. However, if we can't figure out a good shape we could leave
it as something simple for now, and iterate on it later.

I think chiseling shapes is sort of too complex, but we'll need
playtesting to make sure that is the case. If it is too complex, then
we can change the chisel blocker to have more nodes, or have a line
mode where it's a bunch of points you can move around with only
straight lines. You can then switch between this mode (default) and
the smooth mode (we'll do a pixelizer pass on this like Aseprite).
