TODO
  - Redo Chiseling
     x Re-add chisel pressure.
     - Re-add tutorial strings where necessary in chisel.c.
     - Hand-make sprites for each rotation.

  - Add water to one of the intial states!

  - Add a mouse feature for the web version to emulate the movement
    of the mouse in the desktop version.

  - Debug crash that happens when you Ctrl+G through many levels
    until you end up at level 7. Something with the memory gets messed
    up which first manifests as the snow being less in the opening.
    Very curious.
