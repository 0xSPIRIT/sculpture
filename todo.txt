3 Things
   - Wood chisel blocker.
   - Small radius for deleter points. This is as to avoid using it
     for minute changes.
   - For the deleter, incinerate. Don't dustize the things removed
     via the deleter.

- Play around with the converter.
- Finally, create levels.

- Some kind of crash when closing the game, and sometimes when using
  the material converter... but only when in release mode... sigh.
  Why do these happen so often to me?

- Add ability to join two objects together (Future. Don't care)

- In goto_level, most of those init functions don't need to reallocate
  memory. What they really want is zeroing out the memory.

     ---------------------------Ideas----------------------------

- Make diamond completely brittle unless you use the small chisel.
- Inner monologue, Inscryption-style text between each level. Judging
  yourself or praising yourself. Gets you amped up for the final
  level, setting up the "failure".
- Instead of ending on Glass Body falling down, add some dialogue
  afterward then end on the first level "Alaska". End on happy note?
- Find a way to get the pretension point across better (more than the
  zero-depth glass body). Push that to the dialogue!
- You gain more tools as you go along.

- Orb imagery! Use it in Diamond & Quartz!
  Figures reaching for something that is offscreen
  then we finally see it's the orb
- On the dust layer, check collisions on main grid.
- Put toolbar on left instead of top? Leave space for metadata?

For Level 3 (Conversion), we still need to get a shape.
It must be simple enough to be the second level (you're still getting
used to the chiseling etc.) but also complex enough to be thematically
relevent. I don't want any level to not be thematically tied because
there's just so little of them and the game must be as polished as
possible. However, if we can't figure out a good shape we could leave
it as something simple for now, and iterate on it later.

I think chiseling shapes is sort of too complex, but we'll need
playtesting to make sure that is the case. If it is too complex, then
we can change the chisel blocker to have more nodes, or have a line
mode where it's a bunch of points you can move around with only
straight lines. You can then switch between this mode (default) and
the smooth mode (we'll do a pixelizer pass on this like Aseprite).

Update: Pretty sure the solution is just to have the player draw
lines that convert into a bezier curve, then using that as a base
to do an automated chisel, chiseling everything in that segment
the player just drew on. The option will still be there to chisel
manually for simple modifications, though, such as very fine-tuned
edging, bevels, details, etc.

Progress - Use chisels first, then deleter comes in after a while.

Notes

- Chiseling small portions menially
  is not very fun, especially at the
  start. The music can make it better,
  but let's try to maximize the fun at
  the start.
- Focus on curved, general structures?
  Nothing square / rigid like the
  fireplace.
