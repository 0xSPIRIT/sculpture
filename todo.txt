# TODO

  x For placers, when you suck up something from the initial state,
    it should suck up 1.5x the amount! Make sure to use my_rand(i).

  - Redo level 10. This is way too hard and not good with the way placers work
    Keep the same general idea of layers of diamond and ice, but make it
    not weird and clunky.

  - For level 7, change the confirmation popup when you finish to "no" and "no"
    instead of confirm and cancel.

  - Evaluate if the placer is good.
    - In level "Yearning" the placer is a bit odd? Maybe not though.

  - Improve conversions (design by subtraction) - see test_notes.txt.

  - Test the new implemented placer. // Must be done after levels are redone!

  - For chisels, when in the vicinity of multiple possible points, auto-adjust
    to the one that chisels correctly, rather than the multiple others which
    do not.

  - Determine if the destroy level tool is even necessary?
    Replace it with a restart level thing instead?

  - Hand-make sprites for each rotation.

  - Level 7's narration feels weird!

  - Add a mouse feature for the web version to emulate the movement
    of the mouse in the desktop version.

  - Make a graph of all dates of the files in C:\Users\ameer\AppVerifierLogs

# Long-Term

  - Change all text in tutorials, or converting to images
    or symbols.

  - Graphics :: make it have a rustic feel.

  - Music
     - Ambient: piano, pads/synths, motifs?
