- Improve the chiseling system... BY COMPLETELY AUTOMATING IT.

- Play around with the converter.
- Finally, create levels.

- Change placer behaviour to be continuous in the converter.
- Remove all warnings at /W4

- Some kind of crash when closing the game, and sometimes when using
  the material converter... but only when in release mode... sigh.
  Why do these happen so often to me?

Bugs / Crashes:

  - gui.c button_tick():
       if (input->mouse_pressed[SDL_BUTTON_LEFT]) {
        -> b->on_pressed(data); // 0xC0000005: Access violation executing location 0x00007FF9B9441840
           b->activated = true;
       }

         Most likely to do with reloading the game DLL and memory addresses to function pointers
         changing. So don't use function pointers anywhere in your code.

     ---------------------------Ideas----------------------------

- Make diamond completely brittle unless you use the small chisel.
- Inner monologue, Inscryption-style text between each level. Judging
  yourself or praising yourself. Gets you amped up for the final
  level, setting up the "failure".
- Instead of ending on Glass Body falling down, add some dialogue
  afterward then end on the first level "Alaska". End on happy note?
- Find a way to get the pretension point across better (more than the
  zero-depth glass body). Push that to the dialogue!
- You gain more tools as you go along.

- Orb imagery! Use it in Diamond & Quartz!
  Figures reaching for something that is offscreen
  then we finally see it's the orb
- On the dust layer, check collisions on main grid.
- Put toolbar on left instead of top? Leave space for metadata?

For Level 3 (Conversion), we still need to get a shape.
It must be simple enough to be the second level (you're still getting
used to the chiseling etc.) but also complex enough to be thematically
relevent. I don't want any level to not be thematically tied because
there's just so little of them and the game must be as polished as
possible. However, if we can't figure out a good shape we could leave
it as something simple for now, and iterate on it later.

I think chiseling shapes is sort of too complex, but we'll need
playtesting to make sure that is the case. If it is too complex, then
we can change the chisel blocker to have more nodes, or have a line
mode where it's a bunch of points you can move around with only
straight lines. You can then switch between this mode (default) and
the smooth mode (we'll do a pixelizer pass on this like Aseprite).

Update: Pretty sure the solution is just to have the player draw
lines that convert into a bezier curve, then using that as a base
to do an automated chisel, chiseling everything in that segment
the player just drew on. The option will still be there to chisel
manually for simple modifications, though, such as very fine-tuned
edging, bevels, details, etc.
