  - Redo Chiseling
     x Don't chisel between gaps. eg. in Level 1 you can chisel between
       objects.
         To do this, perhaps use a flood fill first.

     x Small inconsistency with hovering over a cell.
       The chisel doesn't go where you want it to.

     - Add the hammer animation; make it nice and succulent
         => Make a render target for the hammer.
            Do the normal rotation on that texture.
            Then, position and rotate that texture around the chisel.

     - Re-add chisel pressure.

     - Re-add tutorial strings where necessary in chisel.c.

     - Hand-make sprites for each rotation.

  - Add water to one of the intial states!

  - Add a mouse feature for the web version to emulate the movement
    of the mouse in the desktop version.

  - Debug crash that happens when you Ctrl+G through many levels
    until you end up at level 7. Something with the memory gets messed
    up which first manifests as the snow being less in the opening.
    Very curious.
