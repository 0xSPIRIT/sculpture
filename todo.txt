TODO
  - Improve resizeable window. Make it work.
    - Apparently gs->gw*gs->gh is 2x smaller than the actual
      width that the screen is supposed to be..? why?!
    - So I had to multiply or divide shit by 2 randomly.
    - When the initial screen is smaller, the text doesn't scale properly,
      when the screen is largened. Perhaps a stray render target being
      initialized to window_width and window_height instead of the maximum
      desktop_w and desktop_h (these are to overcompensate for the possibility
      that the targets may become that size upon resize)

  - Put F11 prompt on the title screen.

  - Show when the chisel isn't able to chisel better. It makes it
    seem like a bug.
  - Add a mouse feature for the web version to emulate the movement
    of the mouse in the desktop version.
  - Debug crash that happens when you Ctrl+G through many levels
    until you end up at level 7. Something with the memory gets messed
    up which first manifests as the snow being less in the opening. Very curious.
