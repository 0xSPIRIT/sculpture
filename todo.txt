- Converter: Design a completely different system with more
             in-depth mechanics. At the moment there's just a
             "cold" and "hot" mode on a converter that turns
             eg. sand to glass, or dirt to coal. Inspration:
             minecraft brewing potions, furnaces, and crafting?
   x Write the functions for doing the conversion for all the
     converter types.
   - Make the converters render in full coords and not pixel art
     coords.
   - Add the fuel requirements.
   - Refactor the placers to be an array. Generalize.
- Improve the grabber to actually grab objects properly. Upon
  clicking, store the position of a cell in the object then track
  that cell upon grabbing the object.

     ---------------------------Ideas----------------------------

- In the first level, instead of having multiple materials, have only
  one that you actually manipulate and then when you're done, it
  transforms itself into the wood etc. Perhaps do this for some
  levels in the beginning.
- Make diamond completely brittle unless you use the small chisel.
- Inner monologue, Inscryption-style text between each level. Judging
  yourself or praising yourself. Gets you amped up for the final
  level, setting up the "failure".
- Instead of ending on Glass Body falling down, add some dialogue
  afterward then end on the first level "Alaska". End on happy note?
- Find a way to get the pretension point across better (more than the
  zero-depth glass body). Push that to the dialogue!
- You gain more tools as you go along.

- Orb imagery! Use it in Diamond & Quartz!
  Figures reaching for something that is offscreen
  then we finally see it's the orb
- On the dust layer, check collisions on main grid.
- Put toolbar on left instead of top? Leave space for metadata?

For Level 3 (Conversion), we still need to get a shape.
It must be simple enough to be the second level (you're still getting
used to the chiseling etc.) but also complex enough to be thematically
relevent. I don't want any level to not be thematically tied because
there's just so little of them and the game must be as polished as
possible. However, if we can't figure out a good shape we could leave
it as something simple for now, and iterate on it later.

I think chiseling shapes is sort of too complex, but we'll need
playtesting to make sure that is the case. If it is too complex, then
we can change the chisel blocker to have more nodes, or have a line
mode where it's a bunch of points you can move around with only
straight lines. You can then switch between this mode (default) and
the smooth mode (we'll do a pixelizer pass on this like Aseprite).
