  x Improve tutorial
     x Use shift to rotate chisel
  x Make overlay highlighting work again.

  - Redo all levels.
    - Add another level 7 thing but in reverse? Perhaps do it before 7.
    - Ensure the progression is step-by-step.
    - Ensure you have one space on either end of the grid.

  - Graphics :: make it have a rustic feel.

  - Music
     - Ambient: piano, pads/synths, motifs?

  - Hand-make sprites for each rotation.

  - Level 7's narration feels weird!

  - Add a mouse feature for the web version to emulate the movement
    of the mouse in the desktop version.

  - Make a graph of all dates of the files in C:\Users\ameer\AppVerifierLogs

Crashes:

  - Crash on level 7 when trying to press N to go to the next
    level. The buttons in the confirmations seem to be pointing to
    nowhere useful.
