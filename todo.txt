Todo:

  Sunday:

[x] Add surrounding lines to the blocker, and fix all bugs.
[x] Deleter: An automatic chiseler. Unlocked mid- to end-game.
[ ] Fix up the circle generator.

  >=Monday:

[ ] Add ability to join two objects together
[ ] Add more levels

  Bugs:

[ ] Fix bug with chisel going through the blocker.

[ ] There's a memory leak which adds slowly over time. There's probably
    a missing SDL_FreeTexture or SDL_FreeSurface somewhere because it
    still allocates when the game is paused.

[ ] Some kind of crash when closing the game, and sometimes when using
    the material converter... but only when in release mode... sigh.
    Why do these happen so often to me?


Done:

[x] In goto_level, most of those init functions don't need to reallocate
    memory. What they really want is zeroing out the memory.


Notes:

To reduce tediousness, remove focus from chiseling. You start doing it
manually in the first level, then you learn about the chisel blocker, etc.
Tutorialization is very important here. Show things that might seem obvious
to you. At some point you get an automatic chiseler; you highlight a region
and it chisels it for you. So then, you'd just be sort of at an architectural
or planning level, and not being bogged down by the tediousness.

Of cousre, if the levels are given to you specifically as in the first levels,
it'd just be very boring. The point of the future levels is to be given
a prompt, and create something from that prompt, and judge it from your own
merit.
