TODO

  x Remove the deleter
  - Level 5: put the thing on a separate layer.
  x Add "destroy" button to essentially chisel everything in the level.
  - Test the new implemented placer.
  - Improve conversions (design by subtraction) - see test_notes.txt.

  - Redo all levels. Ensure:
    - The progression is step-by-step.
    - You have one space on either end of the grid.
    - The difficulty curve is much smoother.
    - All initial states are cool-looking and have a purpose. (test_notes.txt)

  - Graphics :: make it have a rustic feel.

  - Music
     - Ambient: piano, pads/synths, motifs?

  - Hand-make sprites for each rotation.

  - Level 7's narration feels weird!

  - Add a mouse feature for the web version to emulate the movement
    of the mouse in the desktop version.

  - Make a graph of all dates of the files in C:\Users\ameer\AppVerifierLogs

Crashes:

  - Crash on level 7 when trying to press N to go to the next
    level. The buttons in the confirmations seem to be pointing to
    nowhere useful.
