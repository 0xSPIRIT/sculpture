	[x] With the small chisel, when in corners that
		you can't destroy, when you click, automatically
		relocate to the nearest blob. Make sure the highlight
		works with this too.

	[ ] Maybe find a better level 0 setup instead of just shapes.
		Find something cooler?

	[ ] Video preview for tools.
		[ ] Figure out a way to save states to file including tool positions.
		[ ] Load states from file and store in structure
		[ ] Play back the states in a window.
