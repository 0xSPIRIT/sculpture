TODO

  x Refactor all the level.c code, including level states,
    and especially drawing the outro code.

  - Hand-make sprites for each rotation.

  - Redo all levels.
    - Add another level 7 thing but in reverse. Perhaps do it before 7.
    - Ensure the progression is step-by-step.

  1/2 Add a popup upon next level saying "Are you satisfied?"

  - Add a mouse feature for the web version to emulate the movement
    of the mouse in the desktop version.
