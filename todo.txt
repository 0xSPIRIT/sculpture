TODO
  - Show when the chisel isn't able to chisel better. It makes it
    seem like a bug.
  - Add a mouse feature for the web version to emulate the movement
    of the mouse in the desktop version.
  x Rigidity past level 7
  - Button cracking at level 11 (press it multiple times)
  x Update writing, remove some big words.
  - Particle system becomes more violent after level 7. Used for
    narrative metaphor.
  - Make transition into ending.
  - Figure out a game mechanic or modification to existing ones
    (that's preferred) to showcase how perfectionistic the protag
    is to the point where they're harming themselves mentally.
