TODO :: {

	[ ] It would make more sense if the Glass Body was made out of a
		material that you literally couldn't create. Your confidence
		is just too much.

	[ ] Make the writing show the kind of toll those more complex
		sculptures had on you. How you put yourself through the
		wringer time and time again because you want to make something
		great, complex, and sophisticated- like the masterpieces you
		love by others. The payoff is the serene ending.

	[ ] Make the level 6 overlays change from being REALLY complex
		to the single flower thing. Make it completely different
		and only have a passing resemblence to the final product.

	[ ] Make the overlay in level 9 work w/ dirt.
}

Future TODO (Vague) :: {
	[ ] Tutorial: Make use of the chisel's ability to move after you've clicked,
		perhaps utilize simple video tutorials.

	[ ] Bug with small chisel not getting cells properly. Noticable in level 4.

	[ ] The chisels are limited to blobs by object. If a big circle goes
		over one object of 5 cells, but mostly destroys another object,
		it only does the small 5 cells. Destroy ALL objects.
