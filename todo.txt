  x Redo all rendering code to allow for larger textures.
     x Implement the feature of adding negative positions into rendering targets,
       so most of our actual rendering code can stay the same, and just allow
       for negative coordinates.
     x Also, redo the entire asset file. Horrible stuff.

  - Redo all levels.
    - Add another level 7 thing but in reverse? Perhaps do it before 7.
    - Ensure the progression is step-by-step.

  - Cool gradient background.

  - Graphics :: make it have a rustic feel.

  - Music.

  - Hand-make sprites for each rotation.

  - Add a mouse feature for the web version to emulate the movement
    of the mouse in the desktop version.

  - Make a graph of all dates of the files in C:\Users\ameer\AppVerifierLogs
