x Create drawable highlight to overlay. Purely aesthetic,
  but helps the player with creating shapes. Perhaps add
  a red highlight whenever your chisel is in a space where,
  if you click, it will delete some cells that are a part
  of the highlight.
     x Brush tool
     x Line tool
     x Rectangle tool
     x Fill tool
     x Circle tool
     x Eraser tool (circle & rectangle)
        x Circle
        x Rectangle
     x Modifying sizes

     Essentially, your workflow would consist of getting
     the material in place, then drawing the shape of 
     what you want with the highlight, then just being
     careful about how you're chiseling. No chisel
     blocker nonsense.

- Stage play themed. (Gives reason for narrator, and shows
  that it's telling a story in the first place.)

- Create levels 1-4, and experiment with them & the converter.
  Get them on the right track first.
    - Level 1 "Now Entering..."
    - Level 2 "Alaska"
    - Level 3 "Clock's Ticking"
    - Level 4 "The Process"
  When doing these levels, try having a large screen resolution.
  Modify blob generators as well? Larger circles?

- Grid (improve the circle generator. it's very good so far,
        go far the last time.)

- Some kind of crash when closing the game, and sometimes when using
  the material converter... but only when in release mode... sigh.
  Why do these happen so often to me?

- Add ability to join two objects together (Future. Don't care)

- There's a memory leak which adds slowly over time. There's probably
  a missing SDL_FreeTexture or SDL_FreeSurface somewhere because it
  still allocates when the game is paused.

- In goto_level, most of those init functions don't need to reallocate
  memory. What they really want is zeroing out the memory.


If deleter is still an option:
   - Only use it for large changes. Denounce any points that are in
     any way close together.
   - For the deleter, incinerate. Don't dustize the things removed
     via the deleter.
