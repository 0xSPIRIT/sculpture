TODO
  - Improve resizeable window. Make it work.
  - Put F11 prompt on the title screen.

  - Show when the chisel isn't able to chisel better. It makes it
    seem like a bug.
  - Add a mouse feature for the web version to emulate the movement
    of the mouse in the desktop version.
  - Debug crash that happens when you Ctrl+G through many levels
    until you end up at level 7. Something with the memory gets messed
    up which first manifests as the snow being less in the opening. Very curious.
