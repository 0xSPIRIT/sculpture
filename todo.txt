# TODO

  - The dust is the same color as the chisel highlights!

  - Different materials - different sounds

  - Make the overlay colors way better!

  - With the small chisel, slightly favor cells that are safe to
    chisel to make it feel better.

  - Titlescreen: add previews.

  - Hand-make sprites for each rotation.

  - Idea: Replace some of the tutorial boxes with grid previews and key
    previews on how to do things?

  - For level 7, change the confirmation popup when you finish to "no" and "no"
    instead of confirm and cancel.

  - The cobblestone overlay color is too close to the grey cobblestone.
    It should have a higher contrast. Keep the pink color, though.

  - Add a mouse feature for the web version to emulate the movement
    of the mouse in the desktop version.

  - Make a graph of all dates of the files in C:\Users\ameer\AppVerifierLogs

# Long-Term

  - Change all text in tutorials, or converting to images
    or symbols.

  - Graphics :: make it have a rustic feel.

  - Music
     - Ambient: piano, pads/synths, motifs?
