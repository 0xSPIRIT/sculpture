  - Update: "The prize taunted him, with Max aching to reveal it."

  - Something to do with the rain preferring the left side of
    the scene, when stuff is splashing on to material?

  - Music!!!!!! Focus on the music! Don't procrastinate it!
     - Ambient: piano, pads/synths, motifs?

  - Make the rain be used in another level? Feels underused

  - Graphics :: make it have a rustic feel.
    - GUI
    - Chisels (Improve)
