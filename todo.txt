TODO

  - Improve colors / Add texture to the converter UI

  - Re-record the previews since the indices in the previews
    are out of date after we removed some material types!

  x Remove unused textures from the data folder

  - Playtest levels 7-10
    x 7
    - 8
    - 9
    - 10

  - Music
    - Redo the ending music. Make it more like a solemn acceptance.
    - Make music that corresponds to each area (background change)
      - Piano, electronic, ambient, slowly getting more distorted for each area.
        Tons of empty space in the music. 7 minute long tracks?
        Not just sprinkles like before, use actual melodies, but don't make it
        annoying. Melodic tracks can exist without being annoying!

  - Move the Note: in the material converter section of the recipe book
    to be item counts instead.

  - Make a graph of all dates of the files in C:\Users\ameer\AppVerifierLogs
