Todo:

For the levels, don't worry about making them abide
by the story right now. We need to figure out the
mechanics first, so we're just using these as a
benchmark to actually build up the gameplay first,
and see what works.

[ ] Add more levels!
    [x] Add Level 3 - Heart
    [x] Add Level 4 - Easier tree & Fix the Pressure oddities
    [ ] Add Level 5 - Sandstone + Marble sculpture
    [ ] Add Level 6 - Metamorphosis
    [ ] Add Level 7 - Birdie
    [ ] Add Level 8 - Dirt to Diamond
    [ ] Add Level 9 - Showpiece
    [ ] Add Level 10 - Brittle Body

[ ] Negative fuel amount in level 5?!?!?!?!?!

[ ] For the picking up of dusts, you should not have it on the grid itself,
    since it's pretty distracting while chiseling. Maybe automatically
    picku it up somehow.

[ ] For the beginning levels, you use the predefined overlay, but for the later
    levels, you make your own overlays/helpers and just use the refernce
    image window on the side.

[ ] Add Zoom + WASD Movement to make things easier & more precise when
    working with the chisel.

[ ] The blob generator still needs some work to make it feel less
    scary and freaky when you're chiseling. It should have a very consistent
    feeling to it.

Notes:

To reduce tediousness, remove focus from chiseling. You start doing it
manually in the first level, then you learn about the chisel blocker, etc.
Tutorialization is very important here. Show things that might seem obvious
as the dev. At some point you get an automatic chiseler; you highlight a region
and it chisels it for you. So then, you'd just be sort of at an architectural
or planning level, and not being bogged down by the tediousness.

Of cousre, if the levels are given to you specifically as in the first levels,
it'd just be very boring. The point of the future levels is to be given
a prompt, and create something from that prompt, and judge it from your own
merit.
