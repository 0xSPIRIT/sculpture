TODO
  - Redo Chiseling
     - Re-add tutorial strings where necessary in chisel.c.
     - Large chisel doesn't feel quite as before.
     - Do medium chisel behaviour
     - Do large chisel behaviour
     - Add the hammer animation; make it nice and succulent
     - Don't chisel between gaps. eg. in Level 1 you can chisel between
       objects.
         To do this, perhaps use a flood fill first.
     - Hand-make sprites for each rotation

  - Add a mouse feature for the web version to emulate the movement
    of the mouse in the desktop version.

  - Debug crash that happens when you Ctrl+G through many levels
    until you end up at level 7. Something with the memory gets messed
    up which first manifests as the snow being less in the opening. Very curious.
