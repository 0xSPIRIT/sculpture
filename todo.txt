x Add a proper GUI.
- Add proper GUI button sprites instead of just reusing the sprites.

- Make face chiseling look better... somehow. Figure out a solution

Polish
- Add dust to chiseling.
- Fix the crashes [do some wacky shit lots of placements while running
  in gdb] usually has to do with changing the tool as well. Also
  it sometimes removes some cells in the middle of the screen?? OOB
  array?
- Figure out a simple way to explain all this to the player. Esp
  overheating and placers with the converter.
- Make the blobs for each different type of stone different to give
  them a different feel.
- Make a better GUI for switching tools, and especially different
  placers. The F1-3 system we have going on is whack.
