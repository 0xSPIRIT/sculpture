Start of Session: 5:51 pm

- Create levels 1-4, and experiment with them & the converter.
  Get them on the right track first.
    - Level 1 "Alaska"
    - Level 2 "Elementary"
    - Level 3 "Clock's Ticking"
    - Level 4 "The Process"
  When doing these levels, try having a large screen resolution.
  Modify blob generators as well? Larger circles?



- Grid (improve the circle generator. it's very good so far,
        go far the last time.)
- Replace undo system data structure with a simple array, not a linked list,
  which allocates too much memory.

- Some kind of crash when closing the game, and sometimes when using
  the material converter... but only when in release mode... sigh.
  Why do these happen so often to me?

- Add ability to join two objects together (Future. Don't care)

- In goto_level, most of those init functions don't need to reallocate
  memory. What they really want is zeroing out the memory.


If deleter is still an option:
   - Only use it for large changes. Denounce any points that are in
     any way close together.
   - For the deleter, incinerate. Don't dustize the things removed
     via the deleter.
