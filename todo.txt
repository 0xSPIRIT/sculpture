Future TODO (Vague) :: {
	[ ] Tutorial: Make use of the chisel's ability to move after you've clicked,
		perhaps utilize simple video tutorials.

	[ ] Bug with small chisel not getting cells properly. Noticable in level 4.

	[ ] The chisels are limited to blobs by object. If a big circle goes
		over one object of 5 cells, but mostly destroys another object,
		it only does the small 5 cells. Destroy ALL objects.
