  x Bug with the red flavor text not showing up!

  - Graphics :: make it have a rustic feel.
    - GUI

  - Music
    - Redo the ending music. Make it more like a solemn acceptance.
    - Make music that corresponds to each area (background change)
      - Piano, electronic, ambient, slowly getting more distorted for each area.
        Tons of empty space in the music. 7 minute long tracks?
        Not just sprinkles like before, use actual melodies, but don't make it
        annoying.

  - Move the Note: in the material converter section of the recipe book
    to be item counts instead.

  - Make a graph of all dates of the files in C:\Users\ameer\AppVerifierLogs
