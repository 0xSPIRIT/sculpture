TODO :: {
	[ ] If placer rectangle overlapping with existing, join the objects together.
	[ ] Make tooltips work properly in the GUI.
}

Future TODO (Vague) :: {       [Don't actually use this list.]
    - Finish all the levels (break this down a lot)
    - Most Important: Improve the converter by looking at levels.
    - Better way to destroy large objects.
    - Object joiner ??

	Only do this later:
    - View (WASD + Scroll to compensate for chisel going offscreen)
}
