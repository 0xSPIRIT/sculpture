x Placer: Make circle mode the only mode.
          Perhaps add limit to continuous placement of solids.
x Blobs: Better version of random swapping (don't let diagonals or
         worse, complete singles). Remember, this is stone, not
         butter. Maybe even normal 3x3 squares are too big blobs.
- Undo System.
- Chisel Blocker: Disable & turn on chisel highlights (not red
                  highlight, more lowkey)
- Converter: Design a completely different system with more
             in-depth mechanics. At the moment it's just "cold"
             and "hot" mode on a converter. Insp: minecraft
             brewing potions, furnaces, and crafting.

     ---------------------------Ideas----------------------------

- Orb imagery! Use it in Diamond & Quartz!
  Figures reaching for something that is offscreen
  then we finally see it's the orb
- On the dust layer, check collisions on main grid.

- Reduce wasted space in popup- only furnace needed.
- Put toolbar on left instead of top? Leave space for metadata?

For Level 3 (Conversion), we still need to get a shape.
It must be simple enough to be the second level (you're still getting
used to the chiseling etc.) but also complex enough to be thematically
relevent. I don't want any level to not be thematically tied because
there's just so little of them and the game must be as polished as
possible. However, if we can't figure out a good shape we could leave
it as something simple for now, and iterate on it later.

I think chiseling shapes is sort of too complex, but we'll need
playtesting to make sure that is the case. If it is too complex, then
we can change the chisel blocker to have more nodes, or have a line
mode where it's a bunch of points you can move around with only
straight lines. You can then switch between this mode (default) and
the smooth mode (we'll do a pixelizer pass on this like Aseprite).
