# TODO

  - Improve medium chisel: the straight horizontal/vertical chiseling
    is bad when done repeatedly. It generates weird + shaped artifacts.
    Diagonals seem fine.

  - Redo level 10. This is way too hard and not good with the way placers work
    Keep the same general idea of layers of diamond and ice, but make it
    not weird and clunky.

  - Evaluate if the placer is good.
    - In level "Yearning" the placer is a bit odd? Maybe not though.

  - For level 7, change the confirmation popup when you finish to "no" and "no"
    instead of confirm and cancel.
  - The cobblestone overlay color is too close to the grey cobblestone.

    It should have a higher contrast. Keep the pink color, though.

  - Improve conversions (design by subtraction) - see test_notes.txt.

  - Test the new implemented placer. // Must be done after levels are redone!

  - For chisels, when in the vicinity of multiple possible points, auto-adjust
    to the one that chisels correctly, rather than the multiple others which
    do not.

  - Determine if the destroy level tool is even necessary?
    Replace it with a restart level thing instead?

  - Hand-make sprites for each rotation.

  - Level 7's narration feels weird!

  - Add a mouse feature for the web version to emulate the movement
    of the mouse in the desktop version.

  - Make a graph of all dates of the files in C:\Users\ameer\AppVerifierLogs

# Long-Term

  - Change all text in tutorials, or converting to images
    or symbols.

  - Graphics :: make it have a rustic feel.

  - Music
     - Ambient: piano, pads/synths, motifs?
