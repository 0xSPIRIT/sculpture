Level 1:

Inching towards the block of stone, 
accompanied by an assortment of chisels.
You were always fascinated by them- the sculptures.
Worlds of detail tucked behind the stone,
waiting to be revealed.
Your eyes widen like never before,
a flame previously dormant sparking in you.

Level 3:

The single flame grows, blossoming into blazing fire.
What whispers of inspiration do you hear?
Which shapes and patterns beg you to be sculpted?
Wondrous minutes went by, daydreaming fantastical possibilities.
You can fully picture it.
A beautiful symbolic piece, with endless complex details.
... No.
Only when you've sharpened your skills,
will you dare to unleash your full potential.
...
The flame flickers for a moment.

Level 6:

Surely by now you were ready, right?
To do something detailed- important.
You remember the sculptures that danced in your mind's eye.
Hypnotized by an idea, in reverie, you snap back.
With your expectations tempered, you pick up your chisel.

Level 7:

At the end you should be proud of your work, but how could you?
It's a slap in the face.
A sudden jolt back to reality,
to the detached, dispassionate nature of the truth.
With compromise after compromise,
this is all you could settle for?
A tiny fraction of what it could have been-
No, SHOULD have been.
It's like it was all for nothing.
"I'll never make this mistake again," you say,
"I'll never settle for anything less than what is expected."

Level 9:

A thought captures you once again,
condensing wildly into many ideas,
but this time, you're ready for it.
Beaming white shines from your eyes,
reflecting an object with layers of diamond and ice.
When you close your eyes, it's there.
The prize taunts you, aching for you to reveal it.
You can do this.
You know you can do this.

Level 10:

Armed with your honed artistry, you continue onwards.
You'd sculpt an intricate, sophisticated piece.
In fact, very similar to several of your favorites.
Your expertise should clean this one nicely.
You've earned a break.

Ending:

Fixed in place, you stare out your window.
You watch as the people go by.
Life goes on, but you are simply not there.
With the true depth of your work in sight,
you realize you can't do what they did;
yearning to masquerade around as some auteur.
Maybe that's not such a bad thing.
...
Let's move to Alaska.
We'd sculpt the little birds and trees.
And it'll feel good.



Level 3 (fireplace):

As you learn the basics of the form, 
your mind's eye fills with crazy, experimental ideas.
It scratches an itch you never knew you had,
daydreaming even outside of the workshop.
It's a kind of simple joy and excitement-
your single flame steadying into radiance.
