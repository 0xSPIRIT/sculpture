With the game, the player really does make good quality sculptures.
Only when he does level 10, with his massive confidence boost, does
he revert back to that kind of over ambitious mindset and how you're
so good.

The original plan was to make it so that none of your sculptures were
any good, or had weird oddities to them so you can become hard on
yourself after the level 10 debacle. But I think this was is better.
