The dialogue is supposed to be an internal monologue; not a
manifestation of any particular emotion.

  Major things: - More context to the narrative.
                - Amps you up for the final level (not too obvious so
                  that you'd realize something will obviously happen)

The orb represents a goal. Unreachable. It also represents Mavien, the game.



====================

At the ending, after the Brittle Body collapses, the narrator goes:

"What, really, have you made that allows you to think you could create
 something like that?"

(then it flips through each level with captions)
   "the bare essentials?"             (shows the first few levels)
   "the pretentious?"                 (show a level that looks like modern art)
   "some garbage?"                    (show the garbage level)
   "the inferior, never quite your envisioning?"
   "the showpiece, with the foul innards?"
