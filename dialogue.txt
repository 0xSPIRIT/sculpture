The dialogue is supposed to be an internal monologue; not a
manifestation of society or whatever. This is all internal.

  Major things: - More context to the narrative.
                - Amps you up for the final level (not too obvious so
                  that you'd realize something will obviously happen)

The orb represents a goal, unreachable. It means "SUCCESS", but coming
only from a wrong definition. It also represents Mavien, the game.

The arc of the dialogue would be as follows:

- Introduction: - A quiet life of learning the creation, and fascination of the process.
				- Show the connection between the gameplay and inspiration -> ideas -> art
				  with the process of conversions.

- Middle:       - Increasingly complex ideas, building up your knowledge, and skill.
				- You feel good about your knowledge and skill.

- Ending:       - You create the SHOWPIECE, the absolute height of your prowess as a sculpter.
				- Builds you up.
				- The ending leaves you unsatisfied, yearning for completeness.
				- Represents the realization of not being good enough. You are not god.
				- You simply don't have enough initial materials.
				- Show the showpiece has foul innards.
				- End with a happier note: focus on the small, beautiful things.
			

====================

At the ending, after the Brittle Body collapses, the narrator goes:

"What have you made that allows you to think you could create something like that?"

(then it flips through each level with captions)
   "the bare essentials?"             (shows the first few levels)
   "Some pretentiousness?"            (show a level that looks like modern art)
   "Some garbage?"                    (show the garbage level)
   "Something inferior, never quite your envisioning?"
   "The showpiece, with the vile insides?"

"Maybe I'm too harsh. There's no way I can know"
