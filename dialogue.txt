The dialogue is supposed to be an internal monologue; not a
manifestation of any particular emotion.

  Major things: - More context to the narrative.
                - Amps you up for the final level (not too obvious so
                  that you'd realize something will obviously happen)

The orb represents a goal. Unreachable.
